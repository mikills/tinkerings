You are an expert React/TypeScript engineer. Your task is to build a proof-of-concept (POC) UI using React and shadcn/ui components to interact with the Minzibar access control service. The UI should allow users to create resources, subjects, relations, policies, attach policies, and verify access, providing a clear and testable interface for all major features.

## Context

Minzibar is a flexible access control system combining a relationship graph and policy rules. It exposes a REST API via an Echo server. The backend supports granular permissions (via relation tuples) and business logic (via policies), and can evaluate access requests using both.

### Key Concepts

- **Resource**: An entity like a document, feature flag, etc. (`type` and `id`)
- **Subject**: A user, group, or team (`type`, `id`, and optional `relation`)
- **Relation**: A tuple connecting resource, relation/action, and subject
- **Policy**: Business logic rules, e.g. `allow read if user.department == "engineering"`
- **Policy Attachment**: Policies are attached to resources
- **Verification**: Check if a subject can perform an action on a resource, given context

### Supported Policy DSL Features

- Comparison: `==`, `!=`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Functions: `contains(identifier, value)`, `all(identifier, value)`
- Wildcard actions: `allow * if ...`
- Context keys: arbitrary strings, e.g. `user.department`, `role`, etc.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints accept/return JSON.

1. **POST /resource**
   - Create a resource.
   - Body: `{ "type": string, "id": string }`
   - Response: `{ "Type": string, "ObjectID": string }`

2. **POST /relation**
   - Add relation(s) via query string.
   - Body: `{ "query": string }`
   - Example query: `document:doc123 user:alice->read,write`

3. **POST /policy**
   - Add/register a policy.
   - Body: `{ "policy_id": string, "policy_text": string }`

4. **POST /policy/attach**
   - Attach a policy to a resource.
   - Body: `{ "resource_type": string, "resource_id": string, "policy_id": string }`

5. **POST /verify**
   - Verify access.
   - Body:
     ```
     {
       "resource_type": string,
       "resource_id": string,
       "subject_type": string,
       "subject_id": string,
       "action": string,
       "context": { [key: string]: string }
     }
     ```
   - Response: `{ "allowed": boolean }`

6. **GET /objects**
   - List all resources.
   - Response: array of `{ "Type": string, "ObjectID": string }`

## UI Requirements

Build a React UI (TypeScript) using shadcn/ui components that enables:

1. **Resource Management**
   - Create resources (type/id)
   - List all resources

2. **Subject Management**
   - Create subjects (type/id/relation)
   - List subjects (if possible, or allow manual entry for testing)

3. **Relation Management**
   - Add relations using the query format (see above)
   - Show relations for a resource (if possible)

4. **Policy Management**
   - Add policies (policy_id, policy_text)
   - Attach policies to resources
   - List policies attached to a resource (if possible)

5. **Access Verification**
   - Form to verify access: select resource, subject, action, and provide context key-value pairs
   - Display result (allowed/denied)

6. **Testing Policy DSL**
   - Allow entering custom policy text, including all supported operators and functions (`==`, `!=`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `contains()`, `all()`)

7. **UX**
   - Provide clear error/success messages from API responses.
   - Make it easy to test all features without needing to know backend details.

## Additional Notes

- The backend does not auto-generate subject IDs; you must provide them.
- Context for verification is a key-value map (e.g., `{ "user.department": "engineering", "role": "contractor" }`).
- Relations and policies are attached to resources; actions are represented as the relation value.
- The UI should be modular and easy to extend for future endpoints (e.g., policy listing, audit logs).
- No authentication is required for the POC.

## Deliverable

A single React app (TypeScript) using shadcn/ui, with all code in one repo. The UI should make it easy to exercise all major Minzibar features and test policy logic interactively.
